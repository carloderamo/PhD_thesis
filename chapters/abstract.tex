\chapter*{Abstract}
The issue of sample efficiency always constituted a matter of concern in Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, where several works have been proposed to address the problem. It is historically well-known that this issue arises from the need of the agent to explore the environment it is moving in to improve its knowledge about it, and to exploit simultaneously the actions it considers to be the best to maximize its return, creating a trade-off known in RL as exploration-exploitation dilemma. The addressing of this trade-off is central and constitutes a measure of effectiveness of any algorithm available in literature. Moreover, the recent exponential growth of RL research, made possible by the comparable significant improvement in computational power, allowed researchers to extend the study of RL methodologies to high-dimensional problems that were unpractical before, opening the line of research that is now commonly known under the name of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). However, the groundbreaking results that DRL is achieving are obtained at the cost of a huge amount of samples needed for learning, along with very large learning times usually in the order of days. One of the reasons why this is happening, besides the outstanding significance of the results that fundamentally poses the problems of the efficiency of these methodologies in the background, relies on the fact that often experiments are run in simulations in which the sample efficiency problem is not such an issue as in real applications.

The purpose of this thesis is to study the previously described problems proposing novel methodologies that explicitly consider the concept of \textit{uncertainty} to speed up learning and improve its stability. Indeed, since a relevant goal of an RL agent is to reduce uncertainty about the environment in which it is moving, taking uncertainty explicitly into account can be intuitively an effective way of acting. This solution is not new in RL research, but there is still a lot of work that can be done in this direction and this thesis takes inspiration from the available literature on the subject extending it with novel significant improvements on the state of the art. In particular, the works included in this thesis can be grouped into two parts: one where uncertainty is used to improve the behavior of the Bellman equation and the other where it is used to improve exploration. The works belonging to the former group aim to address some of the problems of action-value estimation in the context of value-based RL, in particular in the estimate of the maximum operator involved in the famous optimal Bellman equation, and more generally in the estimate of all its components. On the other hand, the works belonging to the latter group study different methodologies to improve exploration by studying the use of Thompson Sampling in RL or by introducing a variant of the Bellman equation that incorporates an optimistic estimate of the action-value function to improve exploration according to the principle of Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty.

All the works presented in this thesis are described, theoretically studied, and eventually, empirically evaluated on several RL problems. The obtained results highlight the benefits that the explicit exploitation of uncertainty in RL algorithms can provide; indeed, we show how in a large set of problems that have been chosen in order to highlight particular aspects we were interested in, e.g. exploration capabilities, our methods prove to be more stable and faster to learn than others available in the literature.
